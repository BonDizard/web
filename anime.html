<h1 style="text-align:center;color:Violet;"><b>My Top 10 Anime</b> </h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;color:Violet;font-size:160%;"><i>That’s a difficult question to answer owing to the wide variety of anime out there.
But I will try coming up with a list</i></p>
<p style="font-size:160%;color:Violet;font-size:160%;"><i>here are some of my favorite animes....</i> </p>

<h2 style="color:Tomato;"><b> 1.ONE PIECE </b>(adventure)</h2>
<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;" title="my personal favorite""font-size:160%;">It’s really huge when you count the number of episodes but its definitely worth that time.
 I found my best virtual adventure travelling on the seas with the protagonist of the story. Must watch if you have time.</p>

<h2 style="color:Tomato;">2. HAIKYUU (sports)</h2>

<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;font-size:160%;">By far my favorite sports anime.
 I have watched this anime about 4–5 times and it gives same level of entertainment.</p>

<h2 style="color:Tomato;">3.Steins Gate (sci-fi)</h2>

<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;">Its a series with very relatable characters and great dynamics between them, a masterfully crafted and immaculately executed plot with some incredible twists and turns, one of the greatest protagonists I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing,
 and themes which connected with me on a level I never thought possible.</p>

<h2 style="color:Tomato;">4. isekai ojisan (isekai)</h2>

<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;">If you like isekai shows, this show is a different take on it because the uncle comes back from another world when he wakes up from his coma. He becomes a you tuber and tells his nephew and the nephew's childhood friend about his adventures. It has some funny moments. I'd say give it a try.</p>

<h2 style="color:Tomato;">5. Rainbow (drama)</h2>
<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;">If I haven't made it clear already, Rainbow is an anime worthy among the best. Yet, nothing is without fault and the major one with this anime is that the second half isn't as strong as the first,
 owing to a lack of cohesion between arcs. The second half is closer to a series of short stories for each of the guys.</p>
<img src="onepiece.jpg" alt="Rainbow">

<h2 style="color:Tomato;">6. death note (psychological thrillers)</h2>
<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;">It doesn't matter whether you're an avid anime fan or a stranger to the medium; Death Note is definitely worth a watch.
 The series is one of the best psychological thrillers in anime history and hands down the most intellectually satisfying shows available.</p>
<img src="onepiece.jpg" alt="death note">

<h2 style="color:Tomato;">7. Attack on Titan (action)</h2>
<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;">Today, Attack on Titan earns this title with its immaculate storytelling. Attack on Titan has gradually earned its position as the best new-generation anime since its debut in 2013.
 Since reaching this mark, fans have begun placing the series in conversations with the best anime of all time.</p>

<h2 style="color:Tomato;">8.  Welcome to the NHK (Black comedy Psychological drama Slice of life)</h2>
<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;"> Welcome to the NHK is a well-written and well-told story about a serious subject matter. It has a good pace and just enough of both humor and sadness.
 I enjoyed the series very much and if it is a type of anime you normally enjoy, I am sure you will love this series as well.</p>

<h2 style="color:Tomato;">9. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (adventure)</h2>
<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;">rom unique character designs to constant tonal shifts to great music, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is widely regarded as one of the best anime ever. Hirohiko Araki's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has kept audiences entertained for 35 years and it's earned its spot in the pantheon of essential anime series.</p>
<img src="onepiece.jpg" alt="JoJo's Bizarre Adventure ">
<h2 style="color:Tomato;">10. KonoSuba (isekai)</h2>
<p style="font-size:160%;color:Dodgerblue;">KonoSuba is yet another isekai series filled with tropes, clichés, and an unoriginal story. It's the epitome of generic isekai,
 but fans still seem to adore it anyway. But what KonoSuba lacks in originality, it makes up for in comedy.</p>
